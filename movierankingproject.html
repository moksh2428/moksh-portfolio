<h1>The best movies according to Moksh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Rab ne bana di jodi</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. Its about a love story of an arranged marriage.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titans</h3>
<p>Its my favourite and first anime series that I watched. I loved it</p>
<h3>OM SHANTI OM</h3>
<p> I regard it as a one of the best movies as it follows the concept of immense love,<br/>
    that is carried by one life to another reborn life
